# 3D model of a bust of Alexander the Great

![](alexander.gif)

3D data for recreation of a British Museum object.

Marble portrait head of Alexander the Great: the head was cut to fit into a separately made body. The surface is in good condition with only minor abrasions. The back of the head has been worked to receive the remainder of the hair, which was probably made of another material, such as stucco or plaster.
